1. **Implement a singly linked list with insert and delete operations.**
   
**This project demonstrates the implementation of a Singly Linked List in Python with basic operations:**

- Insert a node at the end

- Delete a node by value

- Display the linked list

A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next one, forming a chain.
