##  Overview  

###  Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
Learn the foundations and advanced concepts of NLP:  
- **Text Preprocessing**: tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal  
- **Word Representations**: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText  
- **Deep Learning Models**: RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs  
- **Transformers**: BERT, GPT, and attention mechanisms  
- **Applications**: sentiment analysis, text classification, NER, machine translation  

###  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
Explore **RAG**, a hybrid framework that combines **information retrieval** with **generative models** to produce contextually relevant, accurate responses.  
- **Dense Vector Search** (FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone)  
- **Knowledge Bases** integration  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with retrieval layers  
- **Applications**: QA systems, chatbots, knowledge-driven assistants
