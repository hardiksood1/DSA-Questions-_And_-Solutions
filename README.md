### NLP and RAG: From Basics to Advanced
This repository provides a comprehensive guide to **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, covering concepts, techniques, and implementations from beginner to advanced levels. Whether you're new to NLP or looking to master cutting-edge RAG systems, this resource offers detailed explanations, practical examples, and hands-on code to help you build robust language models and applications.

### Overview

**Natural Language Processing (NLP) :** Dive into the fundamentals of **NLP, including text preprocessing, tokenization, word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe), and advanced transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT)**. Learn how to process and analyze text data for tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, named entity recognition (NER), and machine translation.
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) :** Explore RAG, a powerful framework that combines **information retrieval** with **generative models** to produce contextually relevant and accurate responses. Understand how RAG integrates dense vector search, knowledge bases, and large language models (LLMs) to enhance question answering, chatbots, and knowledge-driven applications.
